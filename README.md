# Setup & Installation
Gif App is using the [Giphy Api](https://developers.giphy.com/docs/api/#quick-start-guide) for constructing RESTful API.
Create an account in order to have an api key and put it in `secrets.properties` file as following
```
giphyApiKey=Your Api Key
```

# Challenge and difficulties encountered
- Actually the goal is to keep things simple, that why i decided to not use (remove) the Jetpack Pagination,because this has somme constraints that will led me to rethinks some parts of my architecture.
I prefer to implement my own pagination logic in the future.
